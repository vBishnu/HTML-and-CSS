Day 9: Positioning in CSS



Position:

There are 5 ways of using position in CSS.

1. Static

2. Relative

3. Absolute

4. Fixed

5. Sticky



We can use top, bottom, left, and right to set the values of how much we need to move an item.



1. Static: This is the default position, and it does not take any effect, or rather, we cannot make any changes using this value. In static, we cannot move/change these values from the top, bottom, left, or right.





2. Relative: 

An item positions itself set from its position. For example, if an item box 6 is already 800px left from the top, and we put position: relative; and add values to it, let's say left: 200px, then it moves 1000px left from the top.





3. Absolute:

When an item is set to position: absolute; then it looks for a parent/ancestor to relate to and move according to the parent. If there is no parent/ancestor found

The item will position itself according to HTML/entire webpage.





4. Fixed: 

When an item is set to position: fixed; then it stays there no matter how much you scroll up or down through the webpage. Think of a fixed position like something that is glued and screwd, which won't move from its set position. Box 3 is an example in the picture below.





5 Sticky:

In this method, the item stays static unless you scroll to it, and stays there.

But unlike position: fixed, this method does not cross to another div/body/container, as shown in the image below, where box 5 is an example for this method.





There is a "z-index" property, which can only be used after changing the position value to anything except static



Exception: Transform, Filter, Perspective.

 When using absolute position in an item, we know that it looks for its parent/ancestor, but if there are any of these 3 (Transform, Filter, Perspective) properties then it works just like normal position: relative;
